# API_Yandex_Market
:package: :mailbox: The program is designed to get all the pickup points of orders of a particular city/zone and upload the data to Yandex.Market

## My Additions

To work it is necessary to fill the configuration file, namely:

- Fill out the necessary data to access Boxberry and Yandex
- Specify the desired city for downloading. Also, in case you want to load exactly the city in the zone variable you must specify the value [-1]
- If you want to load the whole zone, just specify its number instead of [-1]
